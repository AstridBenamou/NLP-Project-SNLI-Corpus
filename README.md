# NLP-Project-SNLI-Corpus
Natural Language Processing Project :

Natural Language Processing can be divided into two subsets: 
Natural Language Generation and Natural Language Understanding. 

Natural Language Inference (NLI) or Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) is an increasingly important task in natural language understanding. Its aim is to determine the inference relation between a hypothesis and a premise, which are usually short texts. 

For these tasks we need a dataset large enough to train models using neural networks with different methods. The SNLI corpus was created to achieve this goal. It was developed as a benchmark for NLI or to be used as a resource for developing NLP models of any kind.

We studied the article on the Stanford Natural Inference Corpus and tried simple models using this corpus.
To train the model use the file "bilstm.ipynb", to test it use "main.ipynb".
